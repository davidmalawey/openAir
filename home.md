**Welcome to the OpenAir Project**

OpenAir is a collection of solutions for pneumatics design projects, with free designs, available parts, and robust, measurable performance.  Compared with other open-source designs, this project is more digestible for learners of fundamentals.  Here, you'll find modules instead of applications.  Or possibly, full applications from which users can borrow components & concepts to as assets in new projects.

**Relationship to OpenLab Project**
This initiative aims at demonstrating more air-driven functionality for designers with less resources, fewer materials, than I can presently find when observing prototyping efforts with pneumatics.  But this project will lag behind openLabProject for some time because the very scope of materials and resources belonging to the "ideal simple multifunctional lab" is still being refined.  OpenAir resides here as a "notice" that we mustn't exclude pneumatic designs from the achievable functions of openlab.  Also, it resides here as a fertile ground to plant airflow-related developments that stem out of OpenLabProject.  Pneumatics & airflow is so crucial to engineering and so beautifully accomodated by the tools in OpenLab that it naturally deserves a directed set of examples and methods posted, which can steer learners towards very nice outcomes instead of my-unguided-attempt types of outcomes.  So OpenLab will support OpenAir and OpenAir will enhance OpenLab, but as of 2025 the central effort is openLab. (2025.10 DM)


## Scope

The intended scope spans as follows:
* compressed gas
* air flow, internal (such as routing to valves)
* air flow external (such as cooling functions)
* adding pressure (such as pumps)
* releasing pressure (such as spraying)
* storing pressure in a fixed place (such as workshop air compressor)
* storing pressure on-the-go (such as a fire extinguisher)
