## What is OpenAir?

It's a collection of solutions for your pneumatics automation projects, with free designs, easy-to-find parts, and robust measurable performance.  Compared with other open-source pneumatics projects, this project is generalized to offer fundamentals, in digestible pieces.  For example, there may be an open source airbrush design on the web.  The design intention is to acheive a good airbrush performance and improve it through community.  In openAir, if we include an airbrush design it is so the users can borrow the components & concepts to port these assets into new projects.

## Scope

The intended scope spans as follows:
* compressed gas
* air flow, internal (such as routing to valves)
* air flow external (such as cooling functions)
* adding pressure (such as pumps)
* releasing pressure (such as spraying)
* storing pressure in a fixed place (such as workshop air compressor)
* storing pressure on-the-go (such as a fire extinguisher)
