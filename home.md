**Welcome to the OpenAir Project**

OpenAir is a collection of solutions for pneumatics design projects, with free designs, available parts, and robust, measurable performance.  Compared with other open-source designs, this project is more digestible for learners of fundamentals.  Here, you'll find modules instead of applications.  Or possibly, full applications from which users can borrow components & concepts to as assets in new projects.

## Scope

The intended scope spans as follows:
* compressed gas
* air flow, internal (such as routing to valves)
* air flow external (such as cooling functions)
* adding pressure (such as pumps)
* releasing pressure (such as spraying)
* storing pressure in a fixed place (such as workshop air compressor)
* storing pressure on-the-go (such as a fire extinguisher)
