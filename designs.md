This page will be populated over time with the subjects below.  We want users to find the knowledge needed, the parts needed, and the design components to make their own system.

## Fittings
Let's introduce the most common fittings for DIY pneumatics

## Pressure 
What pressures are practical and safe for prototyping with Pneumatics?

## Storage
Let's demonstrate the basic designs for storing pressurized air.
* volume
* What's safe
* condensation & liquids
* corrosion

## Nozzles
How do we select or design a nozzle to release pressure for a desired intention?
* dusting
* moving pistons
* diffusing pressure
* diffusing sound

## Tubing
What types of tubes are best to work with, given these targets?
* ubiquitous products
* sized for application
* affordable material
* matched to design ideals, so the product matches calculations
